## Features
- **Phonics Practice**: Users can learn and practice phonics through interactive lessons.
- **Writing Practice**: Guided writing exercises to improve writing skills. We created an interface to teach users how to write Arabic letters. We trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for this, but it was not efficient in real-life applications due to challenges with varying angles and non-centered Arabic letters.
- **Basic Numeracy**: Lessons and quizzes on basic numeracy skills.
- **Personalized Quizzes**: Tailored quizzes to reinforce learning and practice.
- **Visual Learning**: Images generated to support visual learning.

## Technologies Used
- **Gemini API**: Used to generate lessons dynamically.
- **OpenAI**: Facilitates user interactions.
- **Tensorflow**: Training neural networks to recognize handwritten digits.
- **Dall-E 3**: Generates images to support visual learning.
- **CSS HTML CSS FLASK**: HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, JavaScript adds interactivity, and Flask manages server-side logic, all converging to support the AI-powered features in the app
